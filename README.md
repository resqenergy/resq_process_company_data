Introduction
============

This repo creates:

1. A `csv`-file with all companies in Adlershof:: `crawl_enterprizes_Adlershof.py`
2. It allocates geodata to all companies (Adresses): `get_company_geo_data.py`
3. It assignes to every company a cluster by Branchenzweig: `assign_company_to_cluster.py`
4. It preprocesses the data to be used for nominatim geocoder: `preprocess_companies.py`
5. It gives area, type of use and units for nPro from processed and geocoded data: `get_area_per_type_of_use.py`
6. It appends area, type of use and units of cluster "Parkhaus" since it only exists in seperate data "Gebäudegrunddatensatz"
